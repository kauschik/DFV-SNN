# <b> Deep Facial Verification Using Siamese Neural Network (DFV-SNN)</b>


<i>DFV-SNN (Deep Face Verification with Siamese Neural Networks) is a project that aims to implement face verification using Siamese Neural Networks. The project utilizes captured positive images as the reference and verifies them against a given image to check for a match. The methodology for this project is based on the research paper titled "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition" by K. Chopra, R. Hadsell, and Y. LeCun, which can be found at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf. This research paper serves as the primary reference for the implementation of DFV-SNN. 

In this project, we will be using negative images downloaded from http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/#download as the non-matching images to train our model.</i>

## Problem Statement
In recent years, there has been a growing need for accurate and secure facial recognition systems, particularly in the field of biometrics. However, many existing systems struggle to accurately verify a person's identity when only one sample image is available, known as "one-shot" verification. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a deep learning model that can perform one-shot facial verification using a Siamese Neural Network architecture.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

- To develop a deep learning model that can perform one-shot facial verification using a Siamese Neural Network architecture.
- To evaluate the accuracy and performance of the model on a dataset of positive and negative images of faces.
- To compare the performance of the model with existing methods and state-of-the-art models for one-shot facial verification.
## Methodology
The methodology of this project involves the following steps:

  - Collection and pre-processing of the dataset of positive and negative images of faces.
      
      <i>(I captured positive images myself while implementation but downloaded the negatives.)</i>
  - Implementation of the Siamese Neural Network architecture using a deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
  - Training and evaluation of the model on the dataset.
  - Comparison of the performance of the model with existing methods and state-of-the-art models for one-shot facial verification.
## Algorithm
The deep learning model used in this project is a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) architecture. SNNs are a type of neural network that consist of two identical sub-networks, known as "branches". These branches are used to process two separate inputs and compare their representations to make a prediction. In the case of DFV-SNN, the two inputs are the anchor image and the positive or negative image to be verified.

The SNN architecture used in DFV-SNN consists of three main components:

- Two branches, each consisting of a series of convolutional and fully connected layers, that process the anchor and positive/negative images and generate feature representations of the images.
- A contrastive loss function that measures the similarity between the feature representations generated by the two branches and updates the weights of the branches during training.
- An output layer that makes the final prediction of whether the images match or not based on the similarity between the feature representations.
## Implementation
The implementation of DFV-SNN involves the following steps:

- Collection and pre-processing of the dataset of positive and negative images of faces.
- Implementation of the Siamese Neural Network architecture using a deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- Training and evaluation of the model on the dataset using the contrastive loss function and a suitable evaluation metric such as accuracy or F1 score.
## Future Scope
There are several potential future directions for this project, including:

- Integration of the DFV-SNN model into a real-world facial recognition system.
- Extension of the model to handle larger datasets and more complex one-shot verification tasks.
- This project has the potential to be further developed and applied in the field of face lock technology.
- The verification algorithm could be optimized to increase its accuracy and handle more complex cases.
- The project could be converted into a mobile application, making it more accessible and user-friendly.
